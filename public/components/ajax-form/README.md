ajax-form
=========

HTML forms on performance-enhancing drugs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/garstasio/ajax-form.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garstasio/ajax-form)

## Installation

`bower install ajax-form`

...or if you have a bower.json file with an entry for ajax-form:

`bower update`

See the [component page](http://garstasio.github.io/ajax-form/components/ajax-form/) for complete documentation and demos.


## Integration
Are you developing a form field web component?  Read the instructions below to ensure
your field integrates properly with ajax-form.

### Submitting
Your component will integrate nicely into ajax form provided your custom element
exposes a `value` property that contains the current value of the field.  If this
is not true, then your custom field must ensure a native HTML form field is part of
the light DOM.  In either case, the element with the `value` property must also
contain a `name` attribute.  Your user/integrator will need to include an
appropriate value for this field.

### Validation
If your custom field exposes a native HTML form field in the light DOM, then there
is nothing more to do - ajax-form will respect any validation that your user/integrator
adds to the field.  The constrain attribute(s) MUST be placed on the native HTML form
field.

If your custom field does NOT expose a native HTML form field in the light DOM by
default, and you want ajax-form to respect validation constraints, then you will
need to include a little code to account for this.  Here are the steps to follow:
1. Add an opaque, 0x0 `<input type="text">` field to the light DOM, just before your field.
2. Add a `customElementRef` property to the input, with a value equal to your field.
3. Ensure the validity of the input always matches the validity of your field.  You can
do this via the `setCustomValidity` method present on an `HTMLInputElement`.

See the [`setValidationTarget` method in the `<file-input>` custom element source code](https://github.com/garstasio/file-input/blob/1.1.4/file-input.js#L104)
for an example.


## Testing
```
npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli
bower update
grunt
```

- Running `grunt` without any parameters will test against a few locally installed browsers (see the codebase for details).  

- Running `grunt wct-test:remote` will run tests against a number of browsers in SauceLabs.  Ensure you have your SauceLabs username and key attached to the proper environment variables first.

See [documentation](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) for more details.
