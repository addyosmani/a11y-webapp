## HTML forms on performance-enhancing drugs

The `ajax-form` element adds some more power and features to traditional HTML forms.
Also allows the `<file-input>` custom element (and any other custom element form fields
that have a `name` attribute and a `value`) to be submitted along with other traditional
form elements.

Check out the GitHub repository at https://github.com/garstasio/ajax-form.

### What's wrong with a traditional `<form>`?

1. Form submission changes/reloads the page, and it's not trivial to properly prevent this.
2. You can't send custom headers with a submitted form.
3. You can't (easily) parse the server response after a form is submitted.
4. Programmatically tracking invalid forms/fields is frustrating.
5. You can't send form data as JSON.
6. You have no opportunity to programmatically augment user-entered data before it is sent to the server.

`ajax-form` augments a traditional `<form>` to provide additional features and solve the problems listed above.

### A very simple use of `ajax-form` looks just like a normal `<form>`, with the addition of an `is` attribute:

    <form is="ajax-form" action="my/form/handler" method="post">
        <label>Enter your name: <input type="text" name="full_name"></label>
        ...
    </form>

### The inclusion of the `is="ajax-form"` attribute gives the `<form>` special powers, such as:
1. Callbacks when form validation fails, just before the form is submitted, and after the server has responded.
2. The ability to send custom headers to the server with the submit request.
3. Prevention of a page reload/redirect on submit.
4. The ability to include the [`<file-input>` custom element](https://github.com/garstasio/file-input) as a `<form>` field.

### Submitting
Submit your form just as you would any other form.  For example:
1. Via an `<input type="submit">`.
2. Via a `<button type="submit">`.
3. By calling `submit()` on the `<form>` element.

If you are, for example, using a [`<paper-button>`](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/paper-elements.html#paper-button),
you'll need to [attach a click handler to the button](https://github.com/garstasio/ajax-form/issues/27#issuecomment-64512558)
and submit the form when this handler is invoked.

### Integration with `<file-input>` custom element
Want a better `<input type="file">` element that can be easily styled, has built-in,
customizable validation, and provides an improved API?  Check out the [`<file-input>` custom element](https://github.com/garstasio/file-input).
`ajax-form` allows `<file-input>` custom element to be submitted along with other standard
form fields.  Just include your `<file-input>` element as a child of your `<form is="ajax-form">`.
That's it!

As an added benefit, ONLY valid files (not those that have failed any validation rules setup in your `<file-input>` element)
will be sent along with the request!

### Integration with generic custom elements form fields (such as `<paper-input>`)
You can easily submit a `<paper-input>` or `<core-input>` element.  Just place it
in your `<ajax-form>`, and be sure it has a `name` attribute.  In fact, any
custom element form field with a `name` attribute can be handled by `<ajax-form>`,
provided the value to send to the server is exposed via a `value` property on the
element.

### Integration with `<paper-dropdown-menu>` & `<core-dropdown-menu>`
`<paper-dropdown-menu>` and `<core-dropdown-menu>` elements can be submitted too!
Just place one or more of these element in your `<ajax-form>` and be sure
to include a `name` attribute.

### Modifying the data to be submitted
You have an opportunity to do this by registering a "submitted" event handler.  All data
in the form, parsed into a JavaScript object (keys = field names, values = field values) will
be included on the event's `details.formData` property.  You can modify `formData` however you wish.
Your changes will represent the actual data submitted to your endpoint.  Note that files, if applicable,
will be included in this object as well!

### Handling the request server-side
If you include a `<file-input>` field, files will be sent with a name according to the `name` attribute on the `<file-input>`.
If more than one file has been selected, the `name` attribute for each file in the request
will include a "[]" at the end of the name string.

### Cross-origin form submits (CORS)
Please note that all forms are actually "submitted" using `XMLHttpRequest`.  This means that
your server must include appropriate CORS headers in the response if you want access to the
response data **if the request is a cross-origin request**.  Also, requests with custom headers
will be preflighted as well, so your server must handle these correctly.  [Read more about
CORS on Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS).

__Don't forget to [vulcanize](http://www.polymer-project.org/articles/concatenating-web-components.html)
your main/parent HTML file before deploying into production.  This will ensure
that all of your HTML imports are concatenated into one file.__
